        <h2>Where did chihuahuas come from</h2>
            <p>
                According to Microsoft Copilot, chihuahuas are a dog breed originating from Mexico. The breed is named after the state of Chihuahua in northwestern Mexico, 
                where it was first discovered. They are one of the oldest and smallest dog breeds in the Americas, and they are known for their big personalities despite their tiny size. 
                Chihuahua statues and carvings have been found in ancient Mexican ruins, indicating that these small canines have been beloved companions for centuries.
            <br><br>
                Some sources say that chihuahuas' ancestors, the Techichi dogs, were associated with sacrificial rituals and were believed to guide the souls of the deceased to the afterlife.
                However, the only sacrifice my owners plan to make regarding me is waking up early on cold winter mornings.
